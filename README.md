# Magento 2 Product Questions

Online shoppers may find it difficult to sometimes check the quality or appearance of the product. Such details can only be known when you check the product physically which is not possible in online shopping. To overcome this limitation, Meetanshi has developed ***[Magento 2 Product Questions](https://meetanshi.com/magento-2-product-questions.html)*** extension.


The module allows customers to ask questions related to the products and other customers to answer them on the product page. The admin can also add questions and answers related to the products.

Though the potential customer cannot check the product physically, other customers who have purchased it already can answer their queries about the product. A potential customer tends to trust such user generated content and product answers more than the merchant.

Also, the user generated content increases the SEO value of the product page. Hence, Magento 2 Product Questions is a must-have extension if you want to improve the sales, product page, and visibility in SERPs.
